    <p>The <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;" class="code sh literal-block">$</span>
      symbol has a special meaning when used as a message ID with <span
        style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">XREAD</span>. Given that, what should the
      following command return? </p>
    <pre style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;" class="code sh literal-block">XREAD BLOCK 5000 STREAMS numbers $</pre>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p> The server does not maintain details on how far through a stream individual clients have
          read. It is the client's responsibility to do this. The special message ID <span
            style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;" class="code sh literal-block">$</span> can
          be used the first time a client performs an <span
            style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">XREAD</span> operation and will start
          returning messages created after this operation begin. The client should then store the
          highest ID retrieved from the stream, and use this in subsequent calls to <span
            style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">XREAD</span> so that processing picks up
          from the point at which it left off with no gaps in the data. Using <span
            style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;" class="code sh literal-block">$</span> a
          second time would cause any messages added to the stream between the last time that the
          client connected and now to never reach the client for processing. </p>
