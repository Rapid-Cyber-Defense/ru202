    <p>What's the limit in size for a single Redis stream data structure?</p>
    <label>Choose <u>one</u> answer:</label>
    <choicegroup>
      <choice correct="false">2^32 bytes</choice>
      <choice correct="false"> 2^32 messages</choice>
      <choice correct="false">A single stream can occupy as many bytes as a Redis cluster can
        provide.
      </choice>
      <choice correct="true">A single stream can occupy as many bytes as a single Redis instance can
        provide.

    <solution>
      <div class="detailed-solution">
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>A single stream can be as large as, but no larger than, the Redis instance where it
          resides. Thus, the largest Redis stream on a 50GB Redis instance will be 50GB, assuming no
          other data is stored on the instance.</p>
        <br />
        <p>A stream must be partitioned to work across a Redis cluster. A single stream will not
          automatically be partitioned by Redis across the cluster.</p>
