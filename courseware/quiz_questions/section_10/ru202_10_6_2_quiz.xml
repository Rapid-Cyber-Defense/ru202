    <p>If a stream’s growth is allowed to continue unchecked, what will eventually happen once the
      Redis Server runs out of memory?</p>
    <label>Choose <u>one</u> answer:</label>
    <choicegroup>
      <choice correct="false">Redis will automatically truncate the stream
      </choice>
      <choice correct="false">Redis will delete the largest existing key in the keyspace</choice>
      <choice correct="true">Redis will reject subsequent write operations</choice>
      <choice correct="false">Redis will exit with an out-of-memory error</choice>
    </choicegroup>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Redis does not automatically truncate or otherwise manage the length of streams or the
          resources required to maintain them. A stream’s length has to be managed separately from
          its production and consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a low memory situation, the Redis Server will reject further write operations but will
          continue to serve reads.</p>
