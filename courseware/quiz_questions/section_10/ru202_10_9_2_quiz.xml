    <p>Which of the following are reasons for using consumer groups over a single consumer when
      processing a stream?</p>
    <label>Choose <u>two</u> answers:</label>
    <checkboxgroup>
      <choice correct="false">You need to write the result of processing to a new stream.
      </choice>
      <choice correct="false">You need to segment the stream across different types of consumers.
      </choice>
      <choice correct="true">You need to process the stream messages out-of-order.
      </choice>
      <choice correct="true">Processing the data in your stream requires multiple threads / CPUs in
        order to keep up.
      </choice>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Choose consumer groups when you need to acknowledge messages out-of-order and/or when you
          require multiple consumers / threads / CPUs in order to keep up.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can segment a stream by consumer type using both single consumers and consumer groups.
          In the single consumer case, each consumer must keep track of its own last-processed
          offset.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Also, you can write the results of a processed stream to a new stream with both single
          consumers and consumer groups.
