        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p> Any process with a connection to the Redis database can <span
            style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">XCLAIM</span> messages and reassign them to
          any other consumer. This means that you can separate your recovery logic from your
          consumer logic and place each in different processes for separation of concerns. </p>
