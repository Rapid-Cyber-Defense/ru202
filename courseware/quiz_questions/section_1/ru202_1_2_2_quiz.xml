    <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
      <choice correct="false">An increase in the reliability of the storage systems, such as the
        disks</choice>
      <choice correct="false">An increase in the redundancy of the system's components</choice>
      <choice correct="true">An increase in the number of system components</choice>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          As the number of components in the system increases, so does the probability of the
          failure of one of those components.</p>
        <p>Increasing the reliability of the storage systems and the redundancy of systems
          components actually decreases the probability of failure in a distributed system.
