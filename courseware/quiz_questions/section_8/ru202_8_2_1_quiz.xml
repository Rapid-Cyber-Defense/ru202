      process a single message from a stream? </p>
    <label>Choose <u>two</u> answers:</label>
    <checkboxgroup>
      <choice correct="false">The rate at which producers add new messages to the stream</choice>
      <choice correct="true">Latency in the network connection between the consumer and the Redis
        server</choice>
      <choice correct="true">The data contained in the message</choice>
      <choice correct="false">The number of messages in the stream</choice>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          The length of the stream and the rate at which producers are adding to it do not affect
          the rate at which a consumer can process an individual message. Depending on the task
          being performed, the data in the message may cause the consumer to take longer to
          calculate a result for some messages than others. Additionally, if the consumer is
          connected to the Redis server over a network with variable latency, this will contribute
          to messages being processed at variable speeds.
