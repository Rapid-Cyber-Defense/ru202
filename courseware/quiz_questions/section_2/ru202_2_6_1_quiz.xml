    <p>What portion of the stream's messages will be read by each of our two consumer groups:
      "data_warehouse_writer" and "rolling_average_printer"?</p>
    <label>Pick <u>one</u> answer</label>
    <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
      <choice correct="false">Each can expect to read half of the messages</choice>
      <choice correct="true">Each can expect to read all of the messages</choice>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Both consumer groups receive all of the messages, which are then distributed for
          processing between members of the group. If we added a second consumer to the
          "data_warehouse_writer" group, the work of performing data warehouse tasks would be
          divided between the two but not affect the delivery of entries to the
          "rolling_average_printer" group.</p>
