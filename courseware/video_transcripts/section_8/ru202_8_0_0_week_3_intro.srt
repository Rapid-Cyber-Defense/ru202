00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,490
Welcome to week three of Redis Streams.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,080
This week's topic is consumer groups,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,200
which is Redis Streams' way of distributing

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,120
the consumption of a stream across multiple consumers.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,850
In this week, we're going to cover a lot of ground,

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,190
including how to create consumer groups

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,460
and add consumers to them; how to query

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,360
the state of a consumer group; what the Pending Entries

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,140
List is and why it's important; and how

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,950
to adjust a consumer group's position in a stream.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,250
As in chapter 1, we're providing a hands-on example

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,070
that you can run locally or in your virtual lab

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,720
to help you better understand the material.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,150
As always, if you have any questions,

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,000
please hit us up on the forums.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,500
