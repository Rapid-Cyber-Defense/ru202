00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,200
Congratulations on making it to the end of week 3.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,020
By now, you should know enough about consumer groups

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,090
to start thinking about how you might use them

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,170
in your applications.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,950
We started off with an overview of the consumer scaling problem

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,650
and presented consumer groups as a possible solution.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,120
We then described how to create groups and add consumers.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,150
Hopefully you had a chance to try the hands-on exercise.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,310
We then finished the week by describing

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,620
at-most-once delivery with consumer groups,

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,870
along with some basic administrative commands.

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,140
Next week, we'll touch on quite a few topics.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,710
These will include ways to handle consumer failures,

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,490
the scaling of streams, performance considerations,

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,560
and capacity planning.

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,310
We'll also work on a complete real-world example.

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,134
See you next time.

18
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:53,634
