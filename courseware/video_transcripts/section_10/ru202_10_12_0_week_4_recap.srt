1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,720
It's the end of week four and we're nearly

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,220
done with the course.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,510
This week we looked at consumer recovery, streams internals,

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,560
and sample usage patterns.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,920
We also completed a hands on exercise

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,502
to practice using these techniques.

7
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:17,210
You should now be able to use what you've

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,000
learned to identify where Redis streams can benefit

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
your own projects, and how best to implement

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,730
your specific streaming architecture.

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,860
To complete this course all that remains

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,290
is the final exam, which will become available

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,820
at the start of week 5.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,350
Good luck and thanks for participating.
