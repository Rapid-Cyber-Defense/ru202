00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,340
Hey there, and welcome to Redis University.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,670
This is RU202 Redis Streams.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,430
As you probably well know, streaming is everywhere now.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,680
Social media feeds, sensors, and IoT devices in the field

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,120
are just a few examples of the systems now generating

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,520
multitudes of data in real-time.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,440
To process this data, what's needed

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,480
are robust streaming primitives.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,763
Redis Streams is a new feature of Redis that provides this.

10
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:27,430
In this course, we're going to teach you

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,180
everything you need to know to start being

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,159
successful with Redis Streams.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,230
In week one, we'll provide an introduction

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,630
to distributed systems, messaging,

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,010
and streaming pipelines.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,260
This will provide you with some of the background that

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,900
motivated the design of Redis Streams.

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,090
We'll then go over Redis Streams describing

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,080
the high-level features and providing a working example.

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,360
In weeks two and three, we'll be drilling down

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,610
into the guts of Redis Streams.

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,100
Week two covers producers, consumers,

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,470
and queries against streams.

24
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,680
In week three, we delve into one of Redis Streams most powerful

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,450
features, consumer groups.

26
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,400
Finally, in week four, we'll show

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,800
a number of best practices and patterns

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,950
for using Redis Streams to solve real problems.

29
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,540
We'll also review stream administration and management.

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,350
To get the most out of this course,

31
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,680
you'll want to have a good understanding of Redis

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,380
with some experience working with basic Redis data

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,790
structures.

34
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,350
If you don't have much background,

35
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,500
you may want to consider enrolling in RU101,

36
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,480
our introductory Redis course.

37
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,850
As with all of our courses, if you have any questions,

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,910
please reach out to the teaching assistants

39
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,500
on the course forums, and you'll get the help you need.

40
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,900
Again, welcome to Redis Streams.

41
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,180
We're thrilled to have you along and we sincerely

42
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,200
hope you enjoy the course.

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,700
