1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,960
You've now arrived at the end of week two of our course

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,870
on Redis streams.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,029
This week we saw how to create and populate

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,760
streams using a producer, as well as

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,450
how to read from them using consumers and range queries.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,870
As streams and Pub/Sub provide some overlapping functionality

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,330
in Redis, we also spent some time

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,230
looking at important differences between the two.

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,120
The course continues next week when

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,940
we'll take a deep dive into the creation and management

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,500
of consumer groups.

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,720
You'll learn the Redis way of organizing and managing

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,510
multiple consumers so that they can work together

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,000
to process streaming data.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,060
As part of that, we'll also look at how to manage and recover

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,000
from situations where a consumer may fail,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,070
and messages may need to be reassigned

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,440
to others for processing.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,190
Thanks for spending the time with us.

20
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,510
We'll see you again next week.
