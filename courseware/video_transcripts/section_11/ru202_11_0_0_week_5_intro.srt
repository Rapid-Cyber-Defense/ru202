00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,940
You've now completed all the video tutorials, quizzes,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,230
and homework.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,720
You're almost to the finishing line.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,740
The last week of the course will be your final exam.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,970
The final exam counts for 50% of your grade.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,000
You have a week to complete this exam,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,560
so take your time to read and answer the questions carefully.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,660
After you've submitted your answers,

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,120
you'll be graded automatically.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,510
If you receive a final grade of 65% or more,

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,090
then you'll earn a certificate of completion.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,670

available if you have any questions or need assistance.

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,490
