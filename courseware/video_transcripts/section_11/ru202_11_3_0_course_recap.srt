00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,910
hope it's provided you with the tools you need to successfully

use Redis Streams.

And if you have any feedback or insights

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,520
you want to share with the Redis University team,

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,813
don't hesitate to leave a note on the discussion forums.

11

00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,170
in the near future, where you can leave comments and help

13
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,500
us to improve future versions of Redis Streams.

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,870
Again, we're grateful you've taken the time

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,300
