00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,720
Well, you've finished your first week of Redis Streams.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,180
We've covered what we hope is a lot of exciting new material.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,850
Itamar started off the course

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,610
with a broad introduction to distributed systems,

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,760
stream processing, and streaming pipelines.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,310
This essential background paved the way

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,090
for a general introduction to Redis Streams.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,730
There I presented some of the main features of Redis Streams.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,840
And I tried to show how Redis Streams compares to other Redis

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,470
data structures.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,210
We also studied a working example

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,000
of Redis Streams written in Python.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,740
Having completed this introduction,

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,560
it's now it's time to get down to brass tacks.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,030
Next week, we'll start to describe

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,380
producers, range queries, and consumers in great detail.

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,540
Then in week 3, you'll learn everything

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,160
you ever wanted to know about consumer

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,290
groups and their management.

20
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,150
Looking forward to having you along.
