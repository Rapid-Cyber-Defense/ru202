00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,350
Hi there.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,090
And welcome back to Redis University

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,100
for week two of Redis Streams.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,920
Last week, we introduced some distributed systems

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,260
fundamentals, then took a high-level tour

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,740
of the Redis Streams API.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,440
This week, we'll get hands-on with the Redis Streams

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,820
commands.

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,160
We'll begin with a focus on putting data into Streams

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,200
with the Producer Before moving on

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,840
to explore time range queries, and reading data

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,230
using Consumers.

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,890
Redis Streams and Pub/Sub implement similar concepts,

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,630
but with important differences.

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,190
We'll finish the week with a look

16
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,667
at how these two technologies compare and contrast.

17
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:38,167
