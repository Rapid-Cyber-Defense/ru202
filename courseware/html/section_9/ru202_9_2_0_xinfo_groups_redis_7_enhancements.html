<h2>XINFO GROUPS Enhancements in Redis 7</h2>
<p>Redis 7 introduced two useful enhancements to the output of the <span class="code">XINFO GROUPS</span> command.  Let&apos;s take a moment to look at these.  The new data items help us answer these questions about the state of a consumer group:</p>
<h3>How many entries has each consumer group read?</h3>
<p>Sometimes it it useful to know how many entries consumers in the consumer group have collectively read.  This information is now available in Redis 7.</p>
<h3>What's the current lag for each consumer group?</h3>
<p>Think of a consumer group&apos;s lag as the number of entries that exist in the stream which have yet to be read by any consumer that is a member of the group.</p>
<p>We can observe changes in this value over time to determine whether entries are being produced faster than they are being consumed.  In this case, we might want to use this information to add further consumer instances to the consumer group, so that it can catch up.</p>
<p>Once the lag falls beyond a certain point, we could then scale down the consumer group by removing some consumer instances from it.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In the example that follows, we can see how to get the number of entries read and lag for a consumer group, and how these change as the stream is manipulated.  To see the correct output from the <span class="code">XINFO GROUPS</span> you must be using Redis 7.  If you're using the course <a href="https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru202/blob/main/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank" class="page-link">Docker Compose</a> file, you have a Redis 7 instance.</p>
<p>First, check your Redis server version with the <span class="code">INFO SERVER</span> command:
<p><pre class="code">
127.0.0.1:6379> INFO SERVER
# Server
redis_version:7.0.8
redis_git_sha1:00000000
redis_git_dirty:0
redis_build_id:c869ebfd8f51f71c
redis_mode:standalone
...
</pre></p>
<p>Here, I&apos;m running Redis 7.0.8 so we&apos;re good to go!</p>
<p>First, let's use the <span class="code">XADD</span> command to add 1000 entries to a stream.  They&apos;ll all have the same data inside them, but that doesn&apos;t matter for this example:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
127.0.0.1:6379> 1000 XADD mystream * hello world
"1677530033562-0"
"1677530033564-0"
"1677530033566-0"
"1677530033568-0"
"1677530033570-0"
"1677530033571-0"
...
</pre></p>
<p>If you choose to try this yourself then your stream entry IDs will of course differ, as they are timestamps generated by the Redis server at the point that <span class="code">XADD</span> is run.  This doesn&apos;t matter for this example, what&apos;s important is that we have a stream with 1000 entries in it.  Let&apos;s verify that this is what we have just created:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
127.0.0.1:6379> XLEN mystream
(integer) 1000
</pre></p>
<p>Next, we need to create a consumer group for this stream.  Let's call it <span class="code">consumers</span> and have it start at the beginning of the stream:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
127.0.0.1:6379> XGROUP CREATE mystream consumers 0
OK
</pre></p>
<p>Now we have a consumer group, we can run <span class="code">XINFO GROUPS</span> and see what Redis 7 tells us about the state of the stream&apos;s consumer groups:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
127.0.0.1:6379>  XINFO GROUPS mystream
1)  1) "name"
    2) "consumers"
    3) "consumers"
    4) (integer) 0
    5) "pending"
    6) (integer) 0
    7) "last-delivered-id"
    8) "0-0"
    9) "entries-read"
   10) (nil)
   11) "lag"
   12) (integer) 1000
</pre></p>
<p>Here we can see the two additional data points that were added in Redis 7.  <span class="code">entries-read</span> is currently set to <span class="code">(nil)</span> as no entries have been read (the counter is yet to be initialized).  <span class="code">lag</span> is currently set to <span class="code">1000</span> as the consumer group <span class="code">consumers</span> is currently 1000 messages behind in its processing of the stream.</p>
<p>If multiple consumer groups existed for this stream, we'd see similar output for each.</p>
<p>Let's have two consumers read some entries from the stream, then see how the output of <span class="code">XINFO GROUPS</span> is affected...</p>
<p><pre class="code">
127.0.0.1:6379> XREADGROUP GROUP consumers consumer1 COUNT 1 STREAMS mystream >
1) 1) "mystream"
   2) 1) 1) "1677530033562-0"
         2) 1) "hello"
            2) "world"
127.0.0.1:6379> XREADGROUP GROUP consumers consumer1 COUNT 1 STREAMS mystream >
1) 1) "mystream"
   2) 1) 1) "1677530033564-0"
         2) 1) "hello"
            2) "world"
127.0.0.1:6379> XREADGROUP GROUP consumers consumer2 COUNT 1 STREAMS mystream >
1) 1) "mystream"
   2) 1) 1) "1677530033566-0"
         2) 1) "hello"
            2) "world"
127.0.0.1:6379> XINFO GROUPS mystream
1)  1) "name"
    2) "consumers"
    3) "consumers"
    4) (integer) 2
    5) "pending"
    6) (integer) 3
    7) "last-delivered-id"
    8) "1677530033566-0"
    9) "entries-read"
   10) (integer) 3
   11) "lag"
   12) (integer) 997
</pre></p>
<p>Now we can see that the <span class="code">entries-read</span> counter has updated to reflect the 3 entries that the consumers in the group have read between them.  We also observe that the <span class="code">lag</span> value has reduced by 3 to a new value of 997.  We could monitor the value of <span class="code">lag</span> over time and use it to determine whether or not we need to ramp up our throughput by adding more consumer instances to the consumer group for a while.</p>
<p>Note that the consumers do not need to acknowledge each stream entry read with the <span class="code">XACK</span> command before the <span class="code">lag</span> and <span class="code">entries-read</span> counters are updated.</p>
