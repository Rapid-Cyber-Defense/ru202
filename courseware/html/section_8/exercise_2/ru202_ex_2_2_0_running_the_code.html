<h2>Run the Program</h2>
<p>Type the following commands into a terminal window:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
cd src
python consumer_group.py
</pre></p>
<p>You should see the project start up and generate output similar to the following:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
$ python consumer_group.py
BOB-1: 2 is a prime number
BOB-2: 3 is a prime number
BOB-0: 5 is a prime number
BOB-2: 7 is a prime number
...
BOB-0: 79 is a prime number
BOB-2: 89 is a prime number
CHAOS: Restarted BOB-1
BOB-1: Recovering pending messages...
BOB-0: 97 is a prime number
BOB-1: 101 is a prime number
</pre></p>

<h2>What You Will See</h2>
<p>From the output, we can see three consumers (<span class="code">BOB-0</span>, <span class="code">BOB-1</span>, <span class="code">BOB-2</span>) working together as a consumer group to process a stream of numbers and determine if each number is prime or not.  Each consumer processes messages one-by-one, but as the message processing takes a variable amount of time, it’s not possible to determine which consumer will process which message.</p>

<h2>The "Chaos" Function</h2>
<p>Periodically, a chaos function (<span class="code">CHAOS</span>) restarts one of the consumers, which then has to read its pending entry list so that it can resume processing where it left off.  The program also starts a producer process, which doesn’t output anything but will keep pushing increasing natural numbers to the stream at semi-random intervals.</p>

<h2>STOPPING THE PROGRAM</h2>
<p>To stop the program, click in the terminal window that it is running in, and press <span class="code">Ctrl + C</span>.</p>
